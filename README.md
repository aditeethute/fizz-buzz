# fizz-buzz
This is a simple implementation of the Fizz Buzz game using Python. Fizz Buzz is a common programming challenge where you have to print numbers from 1 to a given number, but for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
